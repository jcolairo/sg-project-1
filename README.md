# Connect 4

Each player has a different color counter. They take it in turns to try to and get 4 of the same color next to each other. It may be vertically, horizontally or diagonally.
Each player has to click in the column they want the counter to appear and it will remain in the next empty slot. The counter changes color after every click.
